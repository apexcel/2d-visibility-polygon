# 2D Visibility Polygon Demo

## Description

![Sample](sample.gif)

This is an implementation of 2d visibility polygon. I ported [this](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine/blob/master/Videos/OneLoneCoder_PGE_ShadowCasting2D.cpp) code to ES6+ my own way. Left-click to create blocks and right-click can toggle the source of light that tracks the mouse pointer. If you want to know more about the theory, I recommend to read articles below.

## Demo

You can check out the demo on [HERE](https://apexcel.github.io/2d-visibility-polygon-demo/) or clone the repo then `npm i && npm run start`. It runs on port `3000`.
